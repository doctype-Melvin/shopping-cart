Another [TOP Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart#assignment)
This project uses React and React Router Dom. 

It's a very basic shop UI that lets users add items to a shopping cart, 
change the amounts of items and shows a modal of cart contents.

## Things to change
The modal display should be changed to invisible when users click
anywhere in the window. Right now the close button needs to be clicked.
Another point is that users can't change the amount of already added items
from the shop view. They have to navigate to the cart to change amounts.
